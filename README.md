# note-taker

## Description

The note-taker app has been an incredibly exploratory experience for understanding Express JS. Through understanding concepts of GET, POST, and DELETE to facilitate functions for retrieving saved data, adding/saving new data, and deleting data. There was also exploration into creating and using middleware or utilities outside of a file through imports/exports.

Click on 'Get Started' to move from the home landing page to the primary functionality page called notes. On the notes page, the user can click on any of the previously saved note to view details. The user can also enter a new note using the + icon at the top right, and then fill in the fields on the right-side. Once details are filled, there will be a floppy-disk icon to save to the db. The user can also click on the trash icons to delete specific notes.
